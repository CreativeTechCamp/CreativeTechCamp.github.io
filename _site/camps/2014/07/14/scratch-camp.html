<h2>Camp Description</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">
	<p>Worldwide, students and technology educators are using Scratch, as it allows computer novices to understand complex programming concepts. In a world where STEM occupations are expected to grow 17% over the next decade, tool that sparks young people’s interest in programming is crucial. 
	</p>

	<p>The course - Creative Coding with Scratch introduces our younger students to the essential building blocks behind object-oriented programming through interactive stories, creative arts and games animation. Complexities of coding are broken into bite-sized, color-coded bits, allowing kids to freely create interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art. A fun drag-and-drop interface encourages students to rearrange and experiment with code in a way that quickly makes sense to them. Learners are empowered to develop and share their creative visions as they learn how to code their own stories, games, as well as how to share their creations on the web. </p>


	<p>We’re looking forward to sharing Scratch Camp with our students this summer (see dates in July), and showing them how their interests in programming can turn into future college majors or careers. Students will be able to take home a copy of your own game at the end of this Scratch programming class. It could be the start of something BIG. The success of Scratch is due to its ability to present vital 21st century skills like critical thinking, logic, problem-solving, and creative development in a way that is inviting, colorful, and engaging. </p>

<h2 id="unplugged-activities">Unplugged Activities</h2>
<p>At our Create Tech Camps, balance is very important. Our Scratch camps are fun and engaging as we also include unplugged activities (off computer time) in the session. We believe this is a healthy balance so that students will not be staring at a computer screen the whole time. Our unplugged activities are designed to be hands-on learning, where students develop knowledge in the technology area.</p>

<p>Examples of our unplugged activities are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Open up a computer - Appreciate the technology evolution of computers and how it relates to day-to-day human interaction</li>
  <li>What is it like to be a Computer? Learn about Binary Decoder key and understand how a computer reads and stores data</li>
  <li>What is the Internet? Learn the different type of methods to deliver messages (Fibre, Wi-Fi, or DSL/Copper Cable) over the Internet.</li>
  <li>Instructing a computer via coding. Team and hands on activities to appreciate that computers follow instructions in sequential and logical manner</li>
</ul>

<p>Greetings! My name is Chun Te, and I am so excited to welcome you to Creative Tech Camps. I grew up playing a lot of computer games. Back in those days in the 1980s, computer games doesn’t come readily like how installed program run today. I will have to write my own code to run the game, hacking the game to advance to the next level.</p>

<p>Technology is constantly evolving, and we are too. The digital native kids of today are said to be ‘fluent’ with technology, but they are typically using the technology around them as mere consumers. While kids today love to consume games, apps and websites, they are not getting exposure in creating them.</p>

<p>Since founding Creative Tech Camps, Audrey and I have strived to make it a place where we want every student to feel inspired and empowered to be creator of technology. We design our tech curriculum to give the adequate amount of exposure to the inner workings of the game and tech world, without overwhelming them.  We see Creative Tech Camps as a springboard for the creators of tomorrow – whether as technopreneur, businesspeople, engineers, social entrepreneurs, scholars, or artists.</p>

<p>Prior to Creative Tech Camps, I trained as an engineer and got my PhD in Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering from Imperial College London. During my PhD years in the UK, I had the joy of teaching and imparting my enthusiasm for technology to undergraduate and summer school students. I facilitated programming courses, app development and participated in a few technology start-up companies. Ever since returning from the UK after a 10-year stint, I have been harbouring the desire to impart my enthusiasm for technology to the future generation here in Malaysia. In 2013, I founded Creative Tech Camps, the first tech camps in Malaysia teaching young people to create and innovate through technology. </p>

<h3 id="ms-audrey-ng">Ms. Audrey Ng</h3>
<p>Hi, I am Audrey and I’m looking forward to having your child join me at Creative Tech Camps, where we engage young people in creating with technology. I graduated from Imperial College, with a Master in Engineering from Imperial College London. I’ve worked in a number of educational projects, from organising a tech day for schools children to mentoring students in a tech inventor competition. It gives me great pleasure to spark the “Aha!” moment in children while they tinker with technology in our Camps. With their new found curiosity, I want to continuously nurture it so they will further explore creating with technology on their own.</p>
