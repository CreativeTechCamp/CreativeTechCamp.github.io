<h2 id="camp-description">Camp Description</h2>
<p>Over the past few years, the Minecraft phenomenon has extended into the academic realm, resulting in overjoyed students, and many befuddled parents. For those unfamiliar with the game, Minecraft is an indie “sandbox game,” meaning players can essentially build and create anything they want using blocks in a virtual 3D world. Explore. Start a farm. Build a mansion or castle. Construct a sports area or develop an entire metropolis. The possibilities are literally endless. That’s why students love it!</p>

<p>Most kids play Minecraft, and so they’re very excited to go in and modify it. The camp – Modding &amp; Java Programming with Minecraft use Java programming, the language used to make thier own mods. Students learn how to code their own blocks, program thier recipes and make custom armor set. It takes kids who would never think about programming to write scripts, transforming their game and make Minecraft truly ‘thiers”</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to sharing Minecraft Camp with our students this summer (see dates in July), and showing them how they can take a hobby like Minecraft, and turn it into a future college majors and possible STEM career. Discover the powerful world of Java programming using Minecraft. Java is one of the most in-demand programming languages on the job market today, and is the development language applicable to engineering, development, 3D rendering and more. Students will be able to take home a copy of their modified game at the end of the camp.</p>

<h2 id="unplugged-actitivies">Unplugged Actitivies</h2>
<p>At our Create Tech Camps, balance is very important. Our Minecraft camps are fun and engaging as we also include unplugged activities (off computer time) in the session. We believe this is a healthy balance so that students will not be staring at a computer screen the whole time. Our unplugged activities are designed to be hands-on learning, where students develop knowledge in the technology area.</p>

<p>Examples of our unplugged activities are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Open up a computer - Appreciate the technology evolution of computers and how it relates to day-to-day human interaction</li>
  <li>What is it like to be a Computer? Learn about Binary Decoder key and understand how a computer reads and stores data</li>
  <li>What is the Internet? Learn the different type of methods to deliver messages (Fibre, Wi-Fi, or DSL/Copper Cable) over the Internet.</li>
  <li>Instructing a computer via coding. Team and hands on activities to appreciate that computers follow instructions in sequential and logical manner</li>
</ul>

<p>Greetings! My name is Chun Te, and I am so excited to welcome you to Creative Tech Camps. I grew up playing a lot of computer games. Back in those days in the 1980s, computer games doesn’t come readily like how installed program run today. I will have to write my own code to run the game, hacking the game to advance to the next level.</p>

<p>Technology is constantly evolving, and we are too. The digital native kids of today are said to be ‘fluent’ with technology, but they are typically using the technology around them as mere consumers. While kids today love to consume games, apps and websites, they are not getting exposure in creating them.</p>

<p>Since founding Creative Tech Camps, Audrey and I have strived to make it a place where we want every student to feel inspired and empowered to be creator of technology. We design our tech curriculum to give the adequate amount of exposure to the inner workings of the game and tech world, without overwhelming them.  We see Creative Tech Camps as a springboard for the creators of tomorrow – whether as technopreneur, businesspeople, engineers, social entrepreneurs, scholars, or artists.</p>

<p>Prior to Creative Tech Camps, I trained as an engineer and got my PhD in Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering from Imperial College London. During my PhD years in the UK, I had the joy of teaching and imparting my enthusiasm for technology to undergraduate and summer school students. I facilitated programming courses, app development and participated in a few technology start-up companies. Ever since returning from the UK after a 10-year stint, I have been harbouring the desire to impart my enthusiasm for technology to the future generation here in Malaysia. In 2013, I founded Creative Tech Camps, the first tech camps in Malaysia teaching young people to create and innovate through technology. </p>

<h3 id="ms-audrey-ng">Ms. Audrey Ng</h3>
<p>Hi, I am Audrey and I’m looking forward to having your child join me at Creative Tech Camps, where we engage young people in creating with technology. I graduated from Imperial College, with a Master in Engineering from Imperial College London. I’ve worked in a number of educational projects, from organising a tech day for schools children to mentoring students in a tech inventor competition. It gives me great pleasure to spark the “Aha!” moment in children while they tinker with technology in our Camps. With their new found curiosity, I want to continuously nurture it so they will further explore creating with technology on their own.</p>
