<p>
In recent years, the Minecraft phenomenon has extended from the gaming world into the academic realm, resulting in overjoyed kids, and many befuddled parents. For those unfamiliar with the game, Minecraft is an indie “sandbox game,” meaning players can build and create anything they want using blocks in a virtual 3D world. 
</p>
<p>
Explore. Start a farm. Build a mansion or castle. Construct a sports area or develop an entire metropolis. The possibilities are literally endless. That’s why kids love it! Most kids who play Minecraft, are excited go in and mod-ify it. 
</p>
<p>
This [Modding &amp; Java Coding with Minecraft] camp by CreativeTechCamp taps into kids’ pre-existing interest to learn and create with technology. Kids will learn how to code custom blocks, brew their own recipes and making cake from dragon eggs. In the process, they will discover the powerful world of Java and real world programming. Java is a highly in-demand language applicable to engineering, visual design, and much more. After the camp, kids will be able to take home their copy of the modified game.

<p><img src="/assets/images/instructors/chun_te.jpg" class="img-responsive inline pull-left pad-l" /></p>

<p>Greetings! My name is Chun Te, and I am excited to welcome you to Creative Tech Camps. I grew up tinkering around with computers; taking it apart, assembling them from scratch and playing lots of games, of course. Back in the 1980s, computer games don’t run directly off-the-shelf. I had to find creative ways to play the games with the limited resources available at hand. Many a time, it includes messing with the computer innards and hacking around till something works.</p>

<p>Technology is constantly evolving, and we are too. The digital native kids of today are said to be ‘fluent’ with technology, but they are typically using the technology around them as mere consumers. While kids today love to consume games, apps and websites, most are not getting exposure to creating with technology.</p>

<p>Since founding Creative Tech Camps, Audrey and I have strived to provide a platform for students to feel inspired and empowered to create with technology. We designed our tech curriculum to give the adequate exposure to the inner workings of their favourite game and tech world, without overwhelming them. We see Creative Tech Camps as a springboard for the creators of tomorrow – whether as technopreneur, business people, engineers, artists, designers, … , the list goes on.</p>

<p>Prior to Creative Tech Camps, I am trained as an engineer and gotten my PhD in Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering from Imperial College London. While I was in UK, I had the joy of teaching and imparting my enthusiasm for technology to undergraduate and summer school students. I facilitated programming courses, electronics lab teaching and even joined a few Internet start-up companies. </p>

<p>Ever since returning from a 10-year stint in the UK, I harboured the desire to impart my enthusiasm for technology to our future generation of Malaysia. Hence in 2013, I started Creative Tech Camps, the first tech camps in Malaysia teaching young people to create and innovate through technology.</p>

<p>Hi, I am Audrey and I look forward to having your child join our Creative Tech Camps, where we engage young children in creating with technology. I graduated from Imperial College London, with a Master in Engineering from Imperial College London. I have worked in a number of education projects, from organising a tech day for school children to mentoring students in a tech inventor competition. It gives me great pleasure to spark the “Aha!” moment in children while they tinker with technology. With their new found curiosity, I want to continuously nurture it so they will further explore creating with technology on their own.</p>
