	<p>Worldwide, students and technology educators are using Scratch, as it allows computer novices to understand complex programming concepts. In a world where STEM occupations are expected to grow 17% over the next decade, tool that sparks young people’s interest in programming is crucial. 
	</p>

	<p>The course - Creative Coding with Scratch introduces our younger students to the essential building blocks behind object-oriented programming through interactive stories, creative arts and games animation. Complexities of coding are broken into bite-sized, color-coded bits, allowing kids to freely create interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art. A fun drag-and-drop interface encourages students to rearrange and experiment with code in a way that quickly makes sense to them. Learners are empowered to develop and share their creative visions as they learn how to code their own stories, games, as well as how to share their creations on the web. </p>


	<p>We’re looking forward to sharing Scratch Camp with our students this summer (see dates in July), and showing them how their interests in programming can turn into future college majors or careers. Students will be able to take home a copy of your own game at the end of this Scratch programming class. It could be the start of something BIG. The success of Scratch is due to its ability to present vital 21st century skills like critical thinking, logic, problem-solving, and creative development in a way that is inviting, colorful, and engaging. </p>

<h2 id="unplugged-activities">Unplugged Activities</h2>
<p>At our Create Tech Camps, balance is very important. Our Scratch camps are fun and engaging as we also include unplugged activities (off computer time) in the session. We believe this is a healthy balance so that students will not be staring at a computer screen the whole time. Our unplugged activities are designed to be hands-on learning, where students develop knowledge in the technology area.</p>

<p>Examples of our unplugged activities are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Open up a computer - Appreciate the technology evolution of computers and how it relates to day-to-day human interaction</li>
  <li>What is it like to be a Computer? Learn about Binary Decoder key and understand how a computer reads and stores data</li>
  <li>What is the Internet? Learn the different type of methods to deliver messages (Fibre, Wi-Fi, or DSL/Copper Cable) over the Internet.</li>
  <li>Instructing a computer via coding. Team and hands on activities to appreciate that computers follow instructions in sequential and logical manner</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/instructors/chun_te.jpg" class="img-responsive inline pull-left pad-l" /></p>

<p>Greetings! My name is Chun Te, and I am excited to welcome you to Creative Tech Camps. I grew up tinkering around with computers; taking it apart, assembling them from scratch and playing lots of games, of course. Back in the 1980s, computer games don’t run directly off-the-shelf. I had to find creative ways to play the games with the limited resources available at hand. Many a time, it includes messing with the computer innards and hacking around till something works.</p>

<p>Technology is constantly evolving, and we are too. The digital native kids of today are said to be ‘fluent’ with technology, but they are typically using the technology around them as mere consumers. While kids today love to consume games, apps and websites, most are not getting exposure to creating with technology.</p>

<p>Since founding Creative Tech Camps, Audrey and I have strived to provide a platform for students to feel inspired and empowered to create with technology. We designed our tech curriculum to give the adequate exposure to the inner workings of their favourite game and tech world, without overwhelming them. We see Creative Tech Camps as a springboard for the creators of tomorrow – whether as technopreneur, business people, engineers, artists, designers, … , the list goes on.</p>

<p>Prior to Creative Tech Camps, I am trained as an engineer and gotten my PhD in Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering from Imperial College London. While I was in UK, I had the joy of teaching and imparting my enthusiasm for technology to undergraduate and summer school students. I facilitated programming courses, electronics lab teaching and even joined a few Internet start-up companies. </p>

<p>Ever since returning from a 10-year stint in the UK, I harboured the desire to impart my enthusiasm for technology to our future generation of Malaysia. Hence in 2013, I started Creative Tech Camps, the first tech camps in Malaysia teaching young people to create and innovate through technology.</p>

<p>Hi, I am Audrey and I look forward to having your child join our Creative Tech Camps, where we engage young children in creating with technology. I graduated from Imperial College London, with a Master in Engineering from Imperial College London. I have worked in a number of education projects, from organising a tech day for school children to mentoring students in a tech inventor competition. It gives me great pleasure to spark the “Aha!” moment in children while they tinker with technology. With their new found curiosity, I want to continuously nurture it so they will further explore creating with technology on their own.</p>
