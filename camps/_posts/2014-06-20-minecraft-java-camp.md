##Camp Description
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">

<p>
In recent years, the Minecraft phenomenon has extended from the gaming world into the academic realm, resulting in overjoyed kids, and many befuddled parents. For those unfamiliar with the game, Minecraft is an indie “sandbox game,” meaning players can build and create anything they want using blocks in a virtual 3D world. 
</p>
<p>
Explore. Start a farm. Build a mansion or castle. Construct a sports area or develop an entire metropolis. The possibilities are literally endless. That’s why kids love it! Most kids who play Minecraft, are excited go in and mod-ify it. 
</p>
<p>
This [Modding & Java Coding with Minecraft] camp by CreativeTechCamp taps into kids’ pre-existing interest to learn and create with technology. Kids will learn how to code custom blocks, brew their own recipes and making cake from dragon eggs. In the process, they will discover the powerful world of Java and real world programming. Java is a highly in-demand language applicable to engineering, visual design, and much more. After the camp, kids will be able to take home their copy of the modified game.
