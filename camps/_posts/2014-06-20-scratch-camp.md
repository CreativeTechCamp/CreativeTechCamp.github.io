<h2>Camp Description</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">
	<p>Worldwide, students and technology educators are using Scratch, as it allows computer novices to understand complex programming concepts. In a world where STEM occupations are expected to grow 17% over the next decade, tool that sparks young people’s interest in programming is crucial. 
	</p>

	<p>The course - Creative Coding with Scratch introduces our younger students to the essential building blocks behind object-oriented programming through interactive stories, creative arts and games animation. Complexities of coding are broken into bite-sized, color-coded bits, allowing kids to freely create interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art. A fun drag-and-drop interface encourages students to rearrange and experiment with code in a way that quickly makes sense to them. Learners are empowered to develop and share their creative visions as they learn how to code their own stories, games, as well as how to share their creations on the web. </p>


	<p>We’re looking forward to sharing Scratch Camp with our students this summer (see dates in July), and showing them how their interests in programming can turn into future college majors or careers. Students will be able to take home a copy of your own game at the end of this Scratch programming class. It could be the start of something BIG. The success of Scratch is due to its ability to present vital 21st century skills like critical thinking, logic, problem-solving, and creative development in a way that is inviting, colorful, and engaging. </p>

##Unplugged Activities
At our Create Tech Camps, balance is very important. Our Scratch camps are fun and engaging as we also include unplugged activities (off computer time) in the session. We believe this is a healthy balance so that students will not be staring at a computer screen the whole time. Our unplugged activities are designed to be hands-on learning, where students develop knowledge in the technology area.

Examples of our unplugged activities are: 

* Open up a computer - Appreciate the technology evolution of computers and how it relates to day-to-day human interaction
* What is it like to be a Computer? Learn about Binary Decoder key and understand how a computer reads and stores data
* What is the Internet? Learn the different type of methods to deliver messages (Fibre, Wi-Fi, or DSL/Copper Cable) over the Internet.
* Instructing a computer via coding. Team and hands on activities to appreciate that computers follow instructions in sequential and logical manner
