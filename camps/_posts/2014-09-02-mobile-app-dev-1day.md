##Camp Description
<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
This <b>1-day Experience</b> camp is the ideal introduction for kids who are interested in learning to create mobile apps. Kids ages of 11-14 will be using App Inventor (a programming language created by MIT & Google) to learn the basic of creating a mobile app. 
</p>
<p>
App Inventor is a visual programming language that allows students to start writing mobile apps, using a block-oriented drag-and-drop interface. It has become a powerful tool for exposing students to the world of computer programming and helping them become creators of technology rather than just consumers of it.
</p>
<p>
Students will learn:
<ll>
    <li>Basic programming constructs</li>
    <li>To create a functional Android mobile game/app</li>
    <li>Learn how to problem solve using computer algorithm</li>
    <li>An introduction to the world of mobile technologies through app development</li>
    <li>Take home their creation at the end of the class</li>
</ll>
</p>
<p><i>
Creating apps has changed my perspective on computers and these so called ‘smartphones’. I realise that phones aren’t smart until you tell them what to do.
