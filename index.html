  <h2>About</h2>

  <h3>Creative Tech Camp</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>
        Founded in 2013, Creative Tech Camp began with a simple mission to provide fun, exciting and hands-on technology education to young children outside of the typical classroom setting. At our camps, young children will be learning to create video games, mobile apps and build DIY robots. What they actually learn are to design, experiment, take feedback from peers, iterate and innovate upon existing ideas – all 21st century skills for today’s children to become creative, innovative and adaptable adults.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Creative Tech Camps, we empower your child with the skills and environment to build something amazing of their own. Placing the power of technology into your child’s hands, they can create apps, design games and even make robots to do their bidding. We want your child discover their inner interest and be inspired to create with technology, rather than just being a consumer of technology.

  <h3>Our Camps</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>
        During school holiday periods, we provide children age 8 to 14 a weeklong of learning to create with technology. Your child will pick up coding, design and problem solving skills, while getting exposure to the inner workings of their favourite games and the tech world around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our camps have 8 students per instructor. This 8:1 ratio promotes personalised instruction for children in an engaging and collaborative setting. We encourage everyone to get up from their seat, to work with their peers and to ask tons of questions
      </p>
      <p>
        Each camp has a blend of hands-on work on computers and un-plugged activities requiring no computers. Fiddling around with code or making things with their hands, young children will soon have an “Aha!” moment and continue to discover how things work on their own. Unplugged activities/sessions will not only lay the groundwork for children’s computational thinking skills, it will help children to appreciate how technology effects the real world around
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all, we want children to leave the camp with relevant 21st century skills.
