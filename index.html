    <h2>About</h2>

    <h3>Creative Tech Camp</h3>
    <p>
      Creative Tech Camp was founded in Dec 2013 to bring important skills around computing, logic and innovation to students outside the classroom. Creative Tech Camp sessions teach young people computing fundamentals as they create video games, mobile apps and robots. They design, experiment, look for feedback from peers and tutors, iterate, and pivot when necessary – all skills that we believe will be crucial for today’s students to become creative, resilient, adaptable adults.
    </p>

    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <p>
      Technology offers valuable experiences which can be both self-expressive and collaborative. Rather than just consume technology, what we set out to do is bringing coding skills and technology together to inspire kids to create and build things.
    </p>
    <p>
      We create a learning environment where technologies tools are accessible, and learners participate in a number of technical development disciplines. They create apps with purpose, producing games that may just spark a movement, writing their own codes to change the way they play the game. They recognize the ability to create things, the fun in solving problems and the curiosity on how things work. This is the “Aha!” moment we want to spark in kids from an early age.
    </p>

    <p>
      We inspire interest in art, math, science, and programming as they create their own games and interactive stories. They design, experiment, look for feedback from peers and tutors, iterate, and adapt when necessary – all skills that we believe will be crucial for today’s students to become creative, resilient and ability to solve problems.
