    <h2>About</h2>

    <h3>Creative Tech Camp</h3>
    <p>
      Founded in 2013, Creative Tech Camp began with a simple mission to provide fun, exciting and hands-on technology education to young children outside of the typical classroom setting. At our camps, young children will be learning to create video games, mobile apps and build DIY robots. What they are actually learn is to design, experiment, take feedback (from peers and tutors), re-iterate and innovate when necessary – all skills that are crucial for today’s students to become creative, resilient and adaptable adults. 
    </p>

    <p> <strong>Explore [and] Create [with] Technology | Start Young</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      At Creative Tech Camps, we empower your child with the skills and environment to build something amazing of their own. Placing the power of technology into your child’s hands, they can create apps, design games and even make robots do their bidding. During school holiday periods children age 9 to 14 will spend five days gaining great skills, and getting exposure to the inner workings of their games and tech world.
    </p>

    <p>
      New for July to August 2014 - we are offering
      <a href="/camps/2014/07/21/minecraft-java-camp.html">Modding and Java Programming with Minecraft</a>
      .
    </p>

    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <p>
      Technology offers valuable experiences which can be both self-expressive and collaborative. Rather than just consume technology, what we set out to do is bringing coding skills and technology together to inspire kids to create and build things.
    </p>
    <p>
      We create a learning environment where technologies tools are accessible, and learners participate in a number of technical development disciplines. They create apps with purpose, producing games that may just spark a movement, writing their own codes to change the way they play the game. They recognize the ability to create things, the fun in solving problems and the curiosity on how things work. This is the “Aha!” moment we want to spark in kids from an early age.
    </p>

    <p>
      We inspire interest in art, math, science, and programming as they create their own games and interactive stories. They design, experiment, look for feedback from peers and tutors, iterate, and adapt when necessary – all skills that we believe will be crucial for today’s students to become creative, resilient and ability to solve problems.
